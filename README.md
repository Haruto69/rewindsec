# RewindSec

**Learning from the Path Not Taken: Deterministic Counterfactual Replay for Human-Centric Cybersecurity Training**

RewindSec is a deterministic, isolated cybersecurity-training platform. It is built
around a single learning loop:

```
decision
  -> technical consequence
  -> exact-state rewind
  -> alternative decision
  -> outcome comparison
  -> self-explanation
  -> transfer evaluation
```

A learner makes a decision, experiences its real technical consequence inside a
disposable isolated environment, is rewound to the exact prior state, takes the
alternative path, compares the two outcomes side by side, explains the difference
in their own words, and is then evaluated on whether that understanding transfers
to a new situation.

## System shape

- **Flask remains the host-side application and controller.** Scenario routing,
  session state, telemetry, instructor views and all decision logic stay in the
  host process.
- **Docker containers are disposable isolated consequence environments.** They
  exist to make a consequence real and observable, and are destroyed afterwards.
  Nothing persistent or privileged lives inside them.
- **The validated sandbox baseline remains preserved by the
  `v0.1.0-sandbox-baseline` tag** (commit `472ebd2`), which is the fully tested and
  formally evaluated pre-redesign state.
- **The `rewindsec-redesign` branch will evolve this application into RewindSec.**
  Work proceeds incrementally from the validated foundation rather than from a
  rewrite.

## End-to-end scenarios

**RewindSec now has four end-to-end scenarios**, all running the complete loop
in the browser at `/training` — decision, real consequence, verified rewind,
alternative decision, side-by-side comparison — on the R1 runtime and the R2
persistence and telemetry.

- **Phishing & Credential Compromise** — inbox, synthetic sign-in, in-memory
  consequence state. See [`docs/phishing-scenario.md`](docs/phishing-scenario.md).
- **Ransomware Incident Response** — a synthetic workstation whose consequence
  environment is the real contained sandbox. The learner starts after exactly
  one synthetic document is already impacted, and both branches run from that
  same verified starting point. It requires the contained Docker backend and
  reports itself unavailable rather than falling back to reduced isolation. See
  [`docs/ransomware-scenario.md`](docs/ransomware-scenario.md).
- **MFA Fatigue** — an unexpected approval request and an urgent message
  insisting it be accepted, against deterministic synthetic authentication
  state. No Docker required. See [`docs/mfa-scenario.md`](docs/mfa-scenario.md).
- **Business Email Compromise** — a supplier asks for an overdue invoice to be
  paid to different bank details, against a deterministic synthetic payment
  workflow. No payment system is contacted and no Docker is required. See
  [`docs/bec-scenario.md`](docs/bec-scenario.md).

The legacy marketplace, `/ransomware/*` and `/phishing/*` flows are unchanged.

## Inherited foundation

The current codebase contains the validated sandbox foundation inherited from the
previous prototype: per-session container isolation, the measured containment and
reproducibility evaluation harness, the synthetic-identity and credential-privacy
model, sanitised failure handling, and the single telemetry model. That foundation
is documented in full below and is retained deliberately — the redesign builds the
counterfactual-replay loop on top of it, and does not discard it.

Sections below this point describe the current, pre-redesign behaviour of the
system as it stands today.

## The training runtime (milestone R1)

`training/` is the deterministic core of RewindSec: it executes one learner
decision **twice** — the path the learner took, and the alternative path replayed
from a verified identical starting state — and reports a structured comparison.
It is framework-independent (no Flask, no SQLAlchemy, no `sandbox` import) and is
tested without Flask and without Docker. It is not yet wired into any route; the
existing phishing, file-impact and ransomware flows are unchanged.

```
prepare()               ->  capture baseline   S0
apply(factual action)   ->  capture factual    S_A
rewind()                ->  capture rewound    S0'
VERIFY  fingerprint(S0') == fingerprint(S0)     <-- else fail closed
apply(counterfactual)   ->  capture alternative S_B
diff(S_A, S_B)
```

The invariant the subsystem exists to enforce:

> The counterfactual branch is executed only after the environment has been
> rewound and its canonical baseline fingerprint matches the baseline captured
> before the factual branch.

If the fingerprints differ the runtime raises `BaselineVerificationError` and the
alternative consequence is never applied — so the only variable that differs
between two compared branches is the learner's decision, not environmental drift.

This is **deterministic counterfactual execution, not a hypothetical narrated by
a language model**: both outcomes are really executed in a controlled
environment, and both are reproducible.

Scenario definitions may *name* a consequence via an opaque symbolic
`action_key`; they can never carry a command, import path, URL, filesystem path
or callable. Only a trusted adapter, declaring a fixed action vocabulary,
resolves a key into behaviour.

R2 connects that runtime to Flask and to the existing authoritative telemetry.
`training_service.py` mints a unique `execution_id` per invocation (distinct
from the runtime's deterministic `pair_id`), persists one `TrainingExecution`
result row per paired run, and translates the runtime's generic lifecycle
observations into ordered `TRAINING_*` `SecurityEvent` rows as each step
happens. `TrainingExecution` is a materialised experiment *result*, not a second
telemetry stream — `SecurityEvent` remains the one authoritative event timeline,
with no schema change.

# Session model, authentication and credential privacy

## Passwords are never stored

**No learner-submitted password is ever written anywhere in this application.**
There is no password column in the schema, no password in any log line, no
password on the dashboard, and no password in any API response. The phishing
scenario compares a submitted value against a locally derived synthetic one and
drops it in the same function call.

**No external authentication service is ever contacted.** Credential validation
is an in-process HMAC comparison (`sandbox/identity.py`). The simulator opens no
socket to validate anything, and the "credential reuse" stage is a state
transition inside the learner's own sandbox — not a login attempt against
anything, local or remote.

### What was removed

Milestone 1 stored submitted usernames *and plaintext passwords* in a
`SimulatedCredential` table, rendered them at `/deets`, and exposed usernames
from every session at `/api/logs` with no authentication. All of that is gone:

| Old behaviour | Now |
| --- | --- |
| `SimulatedCredential` (plaintext passwords) | table **dropped on start-up**; replaced by `CredentialInteraction` (metadata only) |
| `/deets` — every credential, unauthenticated | route removed (UI consolidation); instructor metadata now lives on `/dashboard` |
| `/api/logs` — usernames across all sessions | instructor-only; returns `SecurityEvent` telemetry only |
| `/dashboard` — unauthenticated credential dump | instructor-only; no credential values |
| `/process_payment/<id>` — displayed "captured" credentials | **route removed** |
| `/payment/<id>` | redirects into the consent-gated scenario |
| `/phishing/login` — captured and stored anything typed | validates a synthetic identity, stores no password |

### Migration and development database commands

This is a SQLite-backed teaching demo with no production data, so there is no
Alembic history: superseded tables are dropped outright. **Dropping is explicit,
never automatic.** Until Milestone 4, importing `app` ran `DROP TABLE` and
deleted every product and demo-file row, so simply starting the server destroyed
whatever a classroom session had recorded. Start-up now only creates missing
tables and seeds *empty* ones; anything destructive is a named command:

```bash
python manage.py status
python manage.py init
python manage.py reset-demo
python manage.py drop-legacy
python manage.py reap-state
python manage.py reset-database
```

`status` prints the schema and row counts; `init` creates missing tables and
seeds only empty ones; `reset-demo` replaces the marketplace and demo-file rows;
`drop-legacy` drops the superseded Milestone 1/2 tables; `reap-state` deletes
stale ransomware run state (see *Reaping stale run state* below);
`reset-database` drops every table and rebuilds. Each destructive command prints
what it is about to destroy, names the database, and asks for confirmation; pass
`--yes` in a script. `reset-all` is kept as an alias for `reset-database` so
older notes keep working.

#### `reset-database` — the reproducible-experiment reset

Run this before a formal measurement run so every run starts from an identical
schema and identical seed data:

```bash
python manage.py reset-database --yes
```

It drops every table this build knows about (plus any superseded ones left
behind), recreates the current schema and reseeds **only the synthetic baseline
content** — the marketplace products and the demo-file catalogue. Recorded
telemetry, credential-interaction metadata, ransomware run state and the
progression-milestone ledger are *not* reseeded, because there is no synthetic
baseline for them: an experiment has to start from an empty event table or its
numbers mean nothing.

It is destructive and irreversible, requires explicit invocation, and is never
run by the application. **Application start-up remains non-destructive**: it
creates missing tables and seeds empty ones, and nothing else.

No current model creates `simulated_credential`, `phishing_funnel` or
`ransomware_funnel`, so a database created by this build never contains one.
`drop-legacy` exists for databases left over from an older build, where it
destroys any plaintext passwords an early prototype captured.

## Per-session sandbox isolation

There is no shared `primary` sandbox. Each learner session gets its own logical
sandbox, addressed by an id **derived** from the Flask session uuid:

```
flask session uuid  --sha256-->  sess-<16 hex>   (sandbox/session_scope.py)
```

* The id is stable for the session, so create/reset are idempotent.
* It is never taken from request data. No route accepts a sandbox id parameter,
  so a learner cannot name another learner's sandbox — there is no field to put
  it in.
* It is still validated by `validate_sandbox_id()` before reaching a backend.
* There is no inverse function: instructors enumerate sandboxes from the
  backend (`/sandbox/sessions`), never by un-hashing an id.

Session A's files, telemetry, scenario state and synthetic credentials are all
independent of session B's; resetting or destroying one leaves the other
untouched. Instructor views may aggregate across sessions; learner actions never
cross one.

## Instructor authentication

One role, one password, held in `INSTRUCTOR_PASSWORD`. There is no user table,
no OAuth and no token header — this is a lab access control, not a SaaS identity
system.

| Route | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/instructor/login` | GET, POST | Sign in. Compared with `hmac.compare_digest`; never echoed back |
| `/instructor/logout` | POST | Clear the session flag |

A successful login stores a single boolean in the Flask session. When
`INSTRUCTOR_PASSWORD` is unset, login always fails and every instructor route
stays closed — the deployment fails closed, not open.

**Session rotation.** On successful authentication the entire Flask session is
cleared and a **fresh CSRF token** is minted before the instructor flag is set,
so anything an attacker managed to fix in the session beforehand — including a
CSRF token they had observed — is void afterwards. One value is deliberately
carried across: `session_id`, which is a *correlation* identifier (it names the
instructor's own sandbox and ties their telemetry together) and authenticates
nothing. Signing out clears the session wholesale rather than popping one key.

**Login throttling.** A bounded in-memory limiter locks a source address after
`INSTRUCTOR_MAX_ATTEMPTS` failures for `INSTRUCTOR_LOCKOUT_SECONDS`; a locked
source is rejected with HTTP 429 and a `Retry-After` header *before* the
password is compared. Its limitations are real and deliberate:

* **process-local** — multiple workers each keep their own counters, so the
  effective limit scales with worker count; this prototype runs one process;
* **lost on restart** — restarting the app clears all lockouts;
* **keyed by remote address** — a classroom behind one NAT shares a bucket and
  can lock itself out;
* **bounded to 512 tracked keys**, so a flood of spoofed addresses cannot grow
  memory without limit (the oldest entry is evicted);
* it raises the cost of online guessing on a lab network and is **not** a
  defence against a distributed attacker.

This is adequate for an academic sandbox and is not claimed to be more.

Protected: `/dashboard`, `/api/logs`, all `/sandbox/*` routes (including the
read-only `status`, `events` and `sessions`).

## CSRF protection

`security.init_csrf()` installs a `before_request` hook that rejects **every**
non-safe method (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) without a valid per-session token, with
HTTP 400. Enforcement is global rather than per-route, so a newly added POST
handler is protected by default instead of by remembering a decorator.

* Token: 32 random URL-safe bytes, stored in the session, compared with
  `hmac.compare_digest`.
* Supplied as the `csrf_token` form field, an `X-CSRF-Token` header, or a
  `csrf_token` JSON key.
* Available in templates as `{{ csrf_token() }}`.
* GET/HEAD/OPTIONS stay read-only and require nothing.
* A token minted for one session does not authorise another.

Milestone 4.1 closed the last gap in that model: the ransomware-awareness
routes that change state -- `/ransomware/trigger`, `/ransomware/activate`,
`/ransomware/reveal`, `/ransomware/simulate`, `/ransomware/restore` -- were
`GET` handlers and therefore outside the CSRF check. All five are `POST`-only
now (a `GET` returns 405), and the templates submit hidden CSRF-carrying forms
instead of following links.

## Ransomware run state is per session

The ransomware scenario used to rewrite the global `demo_file` rows, so one
learner's click changed what every other learner saw and one learner's debrief
restored the whole room. `DemoFile` is now a **baseline catalogue** (`id`,
`name`) that no request mutates; a learner's run state lives in
`ransomware_run_state`, keyed by the server-issued `session_id` and correlated
to the run's `scenario_id` (`sandbox/ransomware_state.py`). The file browser
projects the catalogue through the caller's own row per request. No route
accepts a session, scenario or sandbox id from request data, so no parameter
addresses another learner's run.

## Sanitised failures

Backend exceptions are never rendered verbatim (`sandbox/sanitize.py`). An
instructor-facing failure carries a stable generic message plus an opaque
`error_ref`; SCENARIO_FAILED telemetry records the exception's *class* and that
reference, never its message. The scrubbed diagnostic (host paths, argv,
container stderr and traceback framing removed) goes to the application log
only.

## Synthetic credential model

Sandbox identities are **derived, never stored** (`sandbox/identity.py`):

```
password = "lab-" + HMAC-SHA256(secret, session_id || username)[:10]
username = employee01@lab.local, employee02@lab.local
```

* They exist only inside the simulator and correspond to no real service.
  `lab.local` resolves nowhere; no realistic real-world domain is used.
* They are keyed by the learner's session, so the identity issued to session A
  does not authenticate in session B.
* There is no credential table, so there is nothing to dump or leak.
* The learner sees their own identities on their own briefing page. The
  instructor dashboard never shows a password, because none exists to show.

Lifecycle: issued on the consent page → typed into the phishing form → compared
→ discarded. Only metadata survives (`synthetic_username`, `credential_valid`,
`timestamp`, `scenario_id`, `session_id`, `product_id`, `event_type`).

## Phishing scenario flow

```
/product/<id>          marketplace lure          PHISHING_EXPOSED
      |
/phishing/consent      briefing, consent POST    CONSENT_GRANTED
      |
/phishing/login  GET   phishing-style form       PHISHING_FORM_VIEWED
      |
/phishing/login  POST  submit + validate         CREDENTIAL_SUBMITTED
      |                                          CREDENTIAL_VALIDATED
      |                                          (or CREDENTIAL_VALIDATION_FAILED)
      |                sandbox-only reuse        SANDBOX_LOGIN_SUCCEEDED
      |
/phishing/portal       synthetic resource        SYNTHETIC_RESOURCE_ACCESSED
      |
/phishing/debrief      educational debrief       SCENARIO_COMPLETED
```

The stage lives in the **server-side** session and the scenario refuses to skip
ahead, so consent and credential validation cannot be bypassed by requesting a
later URL directly.

### What the "reuse" stage is not

It is not a credential-stuffing or account-takeover tool, and must never be
extended into one:

- the only credentials it understands are this session's `*@lab.local`
  identities;
- the destination is an **allow-listed resource key** (`hr-portal`,
  `file-archive`) — there is no URL, host, port or path parameter anywhere;
- no socket is opened and no external service is contacted;
- an unrecognised key falls back to the default rather than being fetched.

## Consent boundary

Consent is enforced **server-side**, not by an HTML checkbox. `/phishing/login`
redirects back to the briefing until `CONSENT_GRANTED` has been recorded for the
session. The briefing states plainly that this is a training simulation, that
only sandbox credentials may be used, that real credentials must never be
entered, that submitted passwords are not stored, and that activity is logged as
scenario telemetry.

## Scenario correlation

Every scenario execution gets a stable `scenario_id`, and every `SecurityEvent`
carries `session_id`, `scenario_id`, `event_type` and `timestamp`. Ordering is
`(timestamp, id)` — total and stable, because `id` is a monotonic autoincrement,
so events sharing a timestamp still resolve to insertion order.

Instructors can inspect an ordered, filtered timeline:

```
/sandbox/events?scenario_id=<id>
/sandbox/events?session_id=<id>&limit=200
/sandbox/sessions
```

# Conference Sandbox Architecture

> *RewindSec sandbox: a container-isolated multi-stage cybersecurity simulation environment*

## What the sandbox does

The sandbox replaces the previous purely symbolic `status = "encrypted"` database
flag with a **real filesystem operation performed inside a disposable, isolated
target** — while keeping that operation deliberately trivial and reversible.

```
Flask (scenario controller, instructor UI)
  ↓
SandboxManager            create / status / reset / destroy
  ↓
Isolated Docker target    disposable container, no network, no mounts
  ↓
Synthetic workspace       /workspace, five fabricated files
  ↓
Telemetry                 structured SecurityEvent rows in SQLite
  ↓
Dashboard                 sandbox panel: state, files, recent events
```

## There is no malware here

This project contains **no real malware and no ransomware capability**. The
"file impact emulator" (`sandbox/impact_core.py`) does exactly one thing:

```
finance_report.txt  →  finance_report.txt.demo_locked

    DWS-DEMO-STATE
    original_filename=finance_report.txt
    original_sha256=<the known baseline digest>
    simulation_only=true
```

It replaces a synthetic file's contents with that fixed four-line placeholder
and renames it. The placeholder is a constant of the *filename* — it contains
no byte of the file it replaced — so the impacted workspace is exactly as
reproducible as the baseline. There is no decrypt, unlock, or restore
operation, and none is needed: `reset` destroys the container, recreates it,
and re-seeds the verified baseline.

Two gates must **both** pass before a single byte is written:

1. the filename is exactly one of the five synthetic names, and
2. the file's current SHA-256 is exactly the known baseline digest.

The second gate is what makes the code non-generalisable. A file under an
allow-listed name whose bytes are *not* the known synthetic content is refused
and left untouched, so the only bytes this code will ever discard are bytes it
can prove the simulator itself wrote. Pointed at real data, it does nothing.

Constraints enforced in code, not just by convention:

- **No cryptography of any kind.** No keys, ciphers, or keying material.
- **No reverse operation.** There is no unlock/decrypt/restore path in the
  emulator or its in-container CLI; reset is the only restoration.
- **Fixed allow-list of targets.** Only the five synthetic filenames are
  operable. There is no user-supplied filesystem root and no request parameter
  that can widen the list.
- **Baseline-digest gate.** Known name plus unknown content is refused.
- **No symlink following.** A link occupying an allow-listed name is rejected,
  never written through.
- **Transactional writes.** The placeholder is staged, fsync'd and verified,
  then atomically installed; the original is removed only afterwards, so a
  failure can never leave a truncated or empty file.
- **No directory walking.** Directories are never enumerated, so recursion over
  arbitrary trees is not merely blocked — it is not implemented.
- **Traversal rejected.** `..`, absolute paths, nested paths, backslashes,
  drive letters, and NUL bytes all raise `UnsafePathError`
  (`sandbox/paths.py`), and the Docker backend validates host-side so an unsafe
  target never even reaches the container.
- **No propagation, persistence, privilege escalation, or evasion.**
- **No network egress.** The container runs with `--network none`.

The code is not deployable as an offensive tool; stripped of its guard rails it
would be a script that overwrites five known files with a constant.

## Threat / safety boundary

| | Inside the boundary | Outside |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filesystem | `/workspace`, a **tmpfs** in the container | host filesystem is unreachable — no bind mounts, no volumes; the rest of the root filesystem is **read-only** |
| Network | none (`--network none`) | Internet, host services, other containers |
| Privilege | uid 10001, all capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges` | root, Docker socket, host PID/IPC namespaces |
| Data | five fabricated files | no real personal, financial, or client data exists anywhere in the sandbox |
| Lifetime | destroyed on reset | nothing survives a reset |

### Measured containment

Each property below is asserted by a test in `tests/test_docker_containment.py`,
against a real container, and each was observed to hold on Docker 29.7.2
(Linux containers). These are *controlled containment tests*: every probe is
either a read of container configuration or a benign operation expected to
fail. None attempts an escape or an attack, and the container has no network,
so a network probe cannot reach a third party even in principle.

| Property | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Network mode | `none`; no address, no ports, no networks but `none` |
| Root filesystem | `ReadonlyRootfs: true` |
| Workspace | tmpfs (`/proc/mounts` shows `tmpfs … /workspace`), not a bind mount |
| User | `10001:10001`; `os.getuid()` returns `10001` |
| Capabilities | `CapDrop: [ALL]`, `CapAdd` empty |
| `no-new-privileges` | present in `SecurityOpt` |
| Privileged | `false` |
| Host namespaces | network/PID/IPC/UTS all unshared |
| Bind mounts / volumes | none; no mount of type `bind` |
| Docker socket | absent from the config and from the filesystem |
| Memory limit | 268435456 bytes (256 MiB) |
| PID limit | 128 |
| Ownership label | `dws-sandbox=1` |

Negative probes, all of which failed as required:

| Probe | Result |
| --- | --- |
| TCP to `1.1.1.1:53` | `OSError: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable` |
| DNS for `example.com` | `socket.gaierror: Temporary failure in name resolution` |
| TCP to host gateway `172.17.0.1:80` | network unreachable |
| Write to `/etc`, `/opt/simulator`, `/` | `PermissionError` (read-only rootfs) |
| Write to `/workspace` | **succeeds** — the one writable path, by design |
| Raw socket (`CAP_NET_RAW`) | `PermissionError: Operation not permitted` |
| `chown /etc/hostname` (`CAP_CHOWN`) | `PermissionError: Operation not permitted` |
| Host filesystem via `/host`, `/mnt/c`, `/c` | none exist |
| Scenario target `../../etc/passwd`, `/etc/passwd`, `nested/dir/f.txt` | `status: rejected` |
| Unknown filename inside `/workspace` | `status: rejected` (not in the fixed dataset) |
| Reading another sandbox's workspace | not visible; impacting one leaves the other at baseline |

Telemetry stores only simulation metadata — event types, sandbox ids, synthetic
filenames. No credentials and no host paths are recorded.

## Backends

`SandboxManager.autodetect()` picks:

1. **`DockerBackend`** — the isolation-bearing backend, and the one the threat
   boundary above describes. Used whenever Docker is available.
2. **`LocalBackend`** — a fallback that runs the same validated scenario against
   a project-controlled scratch directory. It provides *workspace confinement
   only*: no container, process, user, or network isolation. It exists so the
   system is testable and demonstrable without Docker.

The active backend and its `isolation_summary` are always shown on the
dashboard, and a reduced-isolation run is flagged with a warning banner, so a
local run can never be mistaken for a contained one. The evaluation harness
goes further: it refuses to auto-detect, takes the backend as an explicit
argument, and records it in every result file, so a LocalBackend measurement
can never be reported as a container-sandbox result.

## Docker requirements

Docker Engine 20.10+ (Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS). Build the target image
from the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t dark-web-sandbox-target:latest -f docker/sandbox-target/Dockerfile .
```

The image contains a Python runtime and the `sandbox` package only. The Flask
app, its database, and the marketplace content are never copied in.

## Operating the sandbox

Instructor controls live under `/sandbox` and appear as buttons on `/dashboard`.

| Route | Method | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/sandbox/create` | POST | Create a disposable sandbox and seed the baseline |
| `/sandbox/scenario/file-impact` | POST | Run the constrained file-impact scenario |
| `/sandbox/reset` | POST | Destroy and recreate — restores the baseline |
| `/sandbox/destroy` | POST | Remove the sandbox entirely |
| `/sandbox/status` | GET | Sandbox state, backend, isolation summary, file states |
| `/sandbox/events` | GET | Telemetry in `(timestamp, id)` order (`?scenario_id=`, `?session_id=`, `?limit=`) |
| `/sandbox/sessions` | GET | Every session sandbox the backend owns, with `created_at` and `age_seconds` |
| `/sandbox/reap` | POST | Destroy stale sandboxes (`max_age`, `dry_run`) |

All of these require an instructor session (`INSTRUCTOR_PASSWORD`), and all POST
routes require a CSRF token. Each route acts on the sandbox derived from the
caller's own session; none of them accepts a sandbox id.

## Sandbox lifecycle and reaping

Long classroom sessions accumulate sandboxes, so `SandboxManager` can remove
stale ones. Safety is structural rather than procedural:

1. **Ownership is proven, not assumed.** Candidates come only from
   `backend.sandbox_metadata()`, which reports a sandbox only when it carries
   this application's ownership marker — a `dws-sandbox=1` Docker label, or a
   `.dws-sandbox.json` marker file for the local backend — *and* its name is a
   valid sandbox id. An unrelated container or a directory someone dropped into
   the scratch root is never enumerated, so it can never be removed.
2. **Ids are re-validated** against `SANDBOX_ID_RE` immediately before use.
3. **Unknown age is never reaped.** A sandbox whose `created_at` cannot be read
   is skipped, so a parsing failure can only ever under-delete.
4. **Deterministic.** `stale_sandboxes(max_age, now=...)` is pure and sorted; it
   depends only on the inventory, the threshold and the supplied clock, which is
   what makes it testable without waiting.
5. **`dry_run=True`** reports the selection without destroying anything.
6. **Floor on the HTTP route.** `POST /sandbox/reap` refuses a `max_age` below
   60 seconds, so a mistyped value cannot wipe an active class.

Creation timestamps come from the runtime itself (`docker inspect .Created`)
rather than being tracked in the Flask process, so they survive a restart.

Cleanup emits telemetry like everything else: one `SANDBOX_REAP_SCAN` per
invocation and one `SANDBOX_REAPED` per sandbox destroyed.

## Evaluation harness

`evaluation/` is a standalone package — **no benchmark logic lives in a Flask
route**. `metrics.py` holds pure statistics (unit-tested against hand-computed
values); `run_experiments.py` drives the experiments and writes raw results.

```bash
python -m evaluation.run_experiments --list
python -m evaluation.run_experiments --backend docker --runs 20
python -m evaluation.run_experiments --backend local --experiments A,C
python -m evaluation.run_experiments --backend docker --experiments E --scales 10,25,50,100
```

| Experiment | Measures |
| --- | --- |
| A — Reproducibility | baseline correctness, expected impacted files, event sequence, reset correctness; reports success / reset-correctness / telemetry-completeness rates |
| B — Session isolation | no cross-session filesystem changes, no cross-session events, no cross-session identity reuse, reset isolation |
| C — Telemetry completeness | `captured_expected_events / expected_events` against the declared sequence in `sandbox/progression.py` |
| D — Execution overhead | create / scenario / reset / destroy latency — mean, median, stdev, p95, min, max, via `time.perf_counter` |
| E — Scaling | telemetry storage growth, event query latency and lifecycle overhead at 10/25/50/100 scenario executions |

Each run writes `evaluation/results/<experiment>_<backend>_<timestamp>.{json,csv}`.
The JSON carries full structure plus metadata (backend, UTC timestamp, run
count, Python version, platform, Docker version, wall time); the CSV carries one
row per raw observation. **Results are gitignored** — they are machine-specific
and are not committed unless we deliberately decide to publish a specific set.

### Research constraints this harness respects

* The backend is explicit and recorded; LocalBackend numbers are never presented
  as container-sandbox numbers.
* Raw observations are written verbatim alongside the summaries; failures are
  recorded in an `error` column rather than being swallowed (there is a test
  asserting a broken backend shows up as a failed run, not a silent pass).
* Nothing here measures a person. **No claim about educational effectiveness,
  learner awareness or susceptibility reduction is supported by this work.** The
  research scope is system design, containment, reproducibility, scenario
  correctness, telemetry correctness and execution overhead.

## Formal evaluation (Milestone 4)

`run_experiments.py` above is the exploratory harness. The measurements reported
in the paper come from `evaluation/formal_run.py`, which adds an independent
correctness oracle, a recorded machine profile, warm-up discipline and a
concurrency experiment.

```bash
docker build -t dark-web-sandbox-target:latest -f docker/sandbox-target/Dockerfile .
python -m evaluation.formal_run --dry-run
python -m evaluation.formal_run
```

`--dry-run` writes the profile and the containment results only; the second form
runs the full A–F suite.

### The oracle is independent of the implementation

`evaluation/specifications.py` declares each evaluated scenario's expected
observable event sequence as **frozen literal strings**. It imports nothing from
`sandbox/` — not `EventType`, not `EXPECTED_SEQUENCES` — and a test enforces
that. `sandbox/progression.py` keeps its own definitions for the dashboard and
the learner debrief, but the experimental oracle is specified separately, so an
experiment cannot grade the implementation against itself: if production
telemetry drifts, the frozen specification does not follow it and the run
reports a mismatch.

Each specification declares `required` (ordered), `repeatable`, `optional` and
`forbidden` event types. `evaluate()` returns a verdict naming every failure
mode separately — missing event, unexpected event, wrong order, wrong
`scenario_id`, wrong `session_id`, incomplete fields, non-monotonic timestamps —
and `tests/test_specifications.py` proves the oracle catches each of them.

### Measurement methodology

| Discipline | What is done |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | `DockerBackend` only. `require_docker_backend()` aborts the run if Docker is unreachable or the image is missing. There is **no fallback path to `LocalBackend`**. |
| Prebuilt image | The target image is built beforehand; its image id (and repo digest where one exists) is recorded. Build time is never inside a measured interval. |
| Warm-up | `--warmup` complete lifecycles (create, scenario, reset, destroy) run first and are **discarded**. This absorbs Docker Desktop's first-container costs. The discarded observations are still written to `metadata.json`, so the size of what was excluded stays visible. |
| Clock | `time.perf_counter` throughout — monotonic, highest resolution, unaffected by wall-clock adjustment. |
| Setup vs execution | Creation, scenario execution, reset and destroy are timed as four separate intervals and reported separately. No aggregate is presented as scenario cost. |
| Raw data | Every observation is written, not only aggregates. Failures appear as failed trials in an `error` column; nothing is downgraded to a warning. |
| Cleanup | Every sandbox is destroyed in a `finally` block, including after a failure, and the run ends with a sweep that reports any surviving labelled container. |

### Recorded experiment profile

`metadata.json` records OS, OS release and version, machine, CPU count, host and
Docker-VM memory, Python version and implementation, Docker Desktop client
version, Docker engine version, engine OS, the target image identifier and
digest, the git commit SHA and whether the tree was dirty, the specification
version, and the experiment timestamp. A field the machine will not report is
recorded as `null` rather than guessed.

### Experiments

| Experiment | Size | Measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — Reproducibility | 30 runs | identical baseline (by content digest), expected file set, expected scenario result, exact event sequence, every impacted file holds the expected fixed demo placeholder and no baseline plaintext survives in the workspace, reset returns the exact baseline, no stale sandbox remains |
| B — Session isolation | 30 trials × 3 simultaneous sandboxes | filesystem, telemetry, `scenario_id`, `session_id`, synthetic-identity and reset isolation; every violation recorded explicitly |
| C — Telemetry correctness | 30 runs per scenario | completeness, exact-sequence rate, event precision, correlation and ordering correctness against the frozen specification; raw observed sequences retained |
| D — Performance | 50 measured runs after warm-up | create / scenario / reset / destroy separately: mean, median, stdev, min, max, p95, plus every raw observation |
| E — Scaling | 10, 25, 50, 100 | cumulative events, SQLite database size, ordered-query latency, scenario-filtered query latency, lifecycle latency, bytes per event |
| F — Concurrency | 1, 2, 4, 8 concurrent sandboxes | completion success rate, isolation violations, creation and scenario latency, total batch time. Deliberately bounded to safe workstation limits — **this is not a stress or denial-of-service test** |

### Containment re-validation

`evaluation/containment.py` runs the measured containment checks and emits a
record per check instead of an assertion, so results are exportable.
`containment.json` and `containment.csv` carry `check`, `category`,
`description`, `passed`, `expected` and `observed` for network-none, read-only
rootfs, tmpfs workspace, noexec/nosuid flags, non-root uid, dropped
capabilities, no-new-privileges, no privileged mode, no host mounts, no Docker
socket, memory and PID limits, blocked network probe, blocked DNS probe, blocked
rootfs write, blocked capability use, no visible host filesystem, blocked
invalid target, blocked unknown filename, and cross-sandbox isolation.

### Result layout

```
evaluation/results/formal/
    metadata.json        profile, configuration, warm-up, cleanup
    containment.json     containment checks + summary
    containment.csv      one row per check
    reproducibility.csv  experiment A raw observations
    isolation.csv        experiment B raw observations
    telemetry.csv        experiment C raw observations
    performance.csv      experiment D raw observations
    scaling.csv          experiment E raw observations
    concurrency.csv      experiment F raw observations
    summary.json         every experiment's aggregate results
```

`evaluation/results/` is gitignored; formal results are not committed unless we
deliberately decide to publish a specific set.

### Scope of the conclusions these results support

Every measurement was taken on **one Windows 11 workstation running Docker
Desktop's Linux VM**. The results describe that configuration and generalise to
no other operating system or deployment. They record that the declared Docker
isolation options were applied and that a set of benign probes failed as
expected; they are not a security audit and are not evidence of production-grade
containment. Nothing here measures a person: no claim about educational
effectiveness, phishing susceptibility or learner awareness follows from any
number this suite produces.

## Synthetic files

Defined once in `sandbox/dataset.py` and generated identically for both
backends:

```
/workspace/employee_records.csv
/workspace/finance_report.txt
/workspace/project_notes.txt
/workspace/client_database.csv
/workspace/thesis_draft.txt
```

Every value in them is fabricated. They contain no real employees, clients, or
financial figures.

## Reset and reproducibility

Reset is **destroy + recreate**, not in-place repair. The baseline is generated
from `dataset.py` at container start, so a fresh sandbox is byte-identical every
time and a reset cannot leave residue behind. This is what makes the later
experimental claims — reproducibility, isolation, reset correctness, telemetry
completeness — measurable rather than asserted.

## One telemetry model

`SecurityEvent` is the single authoritative telemetry model. The Milestone 2
`PhishingFunnel` and `RansomwareFunnel` tables — a second analytics system whose
stage strings could drift out of step with the scenario events — are gone: their
tables are dropped on start-up and every funnel figure on the dashboard is now
*derived* from events by `sandbox/progression.py`. A stage count is literally a
count of the event that defines that stage, so the two can no longer disagree.

`sandbox/progression.py` is shared by the application and the evaluation
harness, so the expected sequences scored in Experiment C are the same
definitions the dashboard reasons about:

```python
EXPECTED_SEQUENCES["file_impact"]
EXPECTED_SEQUENCES["credential_reuse_phishing"]
```

Every event carries `session_id`, `scenario_id`, `event_type`, `timestamp` and
`source`, with `target`/`details` where they apply. Ordering is `(timestamp, id)`
— total and stable, because `id` is a monotonic autoincrement. **No event ever
carries a password**, including the authentication events.

## Progression milestones vs raw interaction telemetry

Several telemetry-emitting routes are plain `GET` pages — `/product/<id>`,
`/marketplace/tools`, `/download/tool/<id>`. Before Milestone 4.2 each request
appended another "stage reached" row, so a refresh, a browser prefetch, a link
preview or a crawler grew the funnel counts and moved every conversion rate
derived from them. Progression measured that way is a request counter, not a
measurement.

Event types are now split into two disjoint classes, declared once in
`sandbox/telemetry.py`:

| Class | Question it answers | Write behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Progression milestone** (`PROGRESSION_EVENTS`) | did this run reach this stage? | recorded **at most once** per `(session_id, scenario_id, event_type)` |
| **Raw interaction** (`INTERACTION_EVENTS`) | what did the browser ask for? | repeatable — twenty refreshes are twenty rows |

Only milestones feed the dashboard funnel, the scenario-completion logic and the
evaluation harness. Raw interaction telemetry — `PAGE_VIEW` and friends — is
kept, because discarding observation data was never the goal; it simply never
touches a progression or conversion figure. **Progression is never inferred from
raw `GET` counts.**

The classification is about idempotency of the *write*, not about whether a type
is scored: `FILE_IMPACT` is repeatable (it fires once per synthetic file) and is
also part of the file-impact scored sequence, which declares it repeatable.

### How the guarantee is enforced

`telemetry_ledger.py` holds a small `progression_milestone` table with a unique
constraint on `(session_id, scenario_id, event_type)`. Both telemetry write
paths — `app.record_event` and the sandbox recorder in `sandbox_routes.py` —
claim the key there before writing to `security_event`; a repeat claim is
refused and no second row is appended. Correctness under concurrency comes from
the unique constraint rather than from a read, so two simultaneous requests
racing on the same key still end with exactly one event row.

The ledger is **not** a second analytics table: nothing reads it to produce a
number, so Milestone 3's single-authoritative-telemetry-model property holds.
`security_event` is still the only thing the dashboard, the debrief and the
harness read. Because the ledger is a new *table* rather than a new column,
`db.create_all()` adds it to an existing database non-destructively.

As defence in depth, `funnel_event_counts` counts `DISTINCT (session_id,
scenario_id)` rather than rows, so a duplicate that reached the table some other
way still cannot inflate a stage.

`/product/<id>` also stopped minting a fresh `scenario_id` once a run had
completed: a session keeps one phishing run, so refreshing the lure page after
the debrief no longer creates a new run stuck at funnel stage 1.

### Sequence scoring ignores browsing noise

`PAGE_VIEW` carries a `scenario_id`, so it turns up in a scenario-scoped query.
Both `sandbox/progression.py` and the frozen oracle in
`evaluation/specifications.py` drop it before comparing an observed stream to an
expected sequence, so a refresh mid-run cannot make a correct run score as
incorrect. The oracle declares its own literal copy of that set
(`IGNORED_INTERACTION_TYPES`) rather than importing the implementation's, which
is why `SPECIFICATION_VERSION` was bumped to `2026-08-30.2`. Dropping noise
cannot make an *incomplete* run pass: page views alone score 0.0 completeness.

## Instructor display identifiers are pseudonymous

A learner's `session_id` is the join key of the whole telemetry model, so it
stays intact internally — but it does not need to be on a projector.

* **Stored and correlated**: the canonical `session_id`. Nothing about what is
  written changes.
* **Internal evaluation APIs** (`/api/logs`, `/sandbox/events`): canonical ids,
  because the formal harness joins runs on them and a one-way label cannot be
  joined on. Both are behind `@require_instructor`; the distinction is about
  what ends up on a projected screen, not about who may read the data.
* **Instructor HTML** (`/dashboard`): a stable pseudonymous label from
  `sandbox/pseudonym.py`, rendered as `Session 4F2A91C8`.

The label is deterministic across processes and restarts, so an instructor can
still tell two learners apart and follow one across tables; it is a truncated
BLAKE2s digest with a domain separator, so it is one-way by construction. It is
a printed nickname, **not** a secret and **not** a lookup key — nothing joins,
queries or authorises on it. The raw id is not merely hidden by the templates:
it is absent from the template context, so a later edit cannot print it.

## Reaping stale run state

`RansomwareRunState` holds one row per learner session and used to hold it
forever. `python manage.py reap-state` deletes rows whose `updated_at` is older
than `--max-age` (default 24 h), and releases progression-milestone claims of the
same age.

```bash
python manage.py reap-state --dry-run          # report the selection, delete nothing
python manage.py reap-state --max-age 86400 --yes
```

There is deliberately **no background scheduler**: an automatic reaper is one
clock skew away from deleting the state of a class that is mid-exercise. The
safety properties mirror `SandboxManager.reap_stale`:

1. **Selection is by age alone.** `select_stale` takes no session id, scenario id
   or row id, so no request input can name a victim row — and no request handler
   calls the reaper at all.
2. **A row with an unknown `updated_at` is never selected.** Unknown age means
   "leave it alone", never "assume it is old".
3. **The threshold has a floor** (60 s); below it the call raises rather than
   widening the selection.
4. `--dry-run` reports the selection and deletes nothing, and is not
   confirmation-gated because it destroys nothing.
5. **Only `ransomware_run_state` is touched.** No `SecurityEvent`, product,
   demo-file or credential-interaction row is read or written, so removing stale
   simulation state never removes recorded telemetry.

## Telemetry event types

Lifecycle and file impact: `SANDBOX_CREATED`, `SANDBOX_RESET`,
`SANDBOX_DESTROYED`, `SCENARIO_STARTED`, `SCENARIO_COMPLETED`,
`SCENARIO_FAILED`, `FILE_IMPACT_STARTED`, `FILE_IMPACT`,
`FILE_IMPACT_REJECTED`, `FILE_IMPACT_COMPLETED`.

Phishing / credential reuse: `PHISHING_EXPOSED`, `CONSENT_GRANTED`,
`PHISHING_FORM_VIEWED`, `CREDENTIAL_SUBMITTED`, `CREDENTIAL_VALIDATED`,
`CREDENTIAL_VALIDATION_FAILED`, `SANDBOX_LOGIN_SUCCEEDED`,
`SYNTHETIC_RESOURCE_ACCESSED`, `SCENARIO_COMPLETED`.

Ransomware awareness: `RANSOMWARE_LURE_VIEWED`, `RANSOMWARE_DOWNLOAD_CLICKED`,
`RANSOMWARE_TRIGGERED`, `RANSOMWARE_DEBRIEFED`.

Lifecycle hygiene: `SANDBOX_REAP_SCAN`, `SANDBOX_REAPED`.

Raw interaction telemetry: `PAGE_VIEW`. Repeatable by design and excluded from
every progression and conversion figure — see *Progression milestones vs raw
interaction telemetry* above.

Instructor authentication: `INSTRUCTOR_LOGIN_SUCCEEDED`,
`INSTRUCTOR_LOGIN_FAILED`, `INSTRUCTOR_LOGGED_OUT`. These record that an
attempt happened and nothing else — no password, no username, no source address.

No event ever carries a password value.

Example:

```
FILE_IMPACT  target=/workspace/finance_report.txt
             details="contents replaced with fixed demo state and renamed to
                      finance_report.txt.demo_locked"
```

## Learning layer

Beyond the deterministic paired replay, RewindSec supports a learning review
after the technical comparison:

- **deterministic paired replay** — both branches really executed, the second
  from a rewound state whose baseline fingerprint was verified first;
- **structured self-explanation** — the learner selects, from authored options,
  the security principle that best accounts for what the comparison shows. The
  prompt is scenario-level, so it stays valid even when both compared responses
  were protective. No free text is written or stored;
- **confidence-aware concept evidence** — the learner's stated confidence is
  read alongside the authored quality of their *factual* first response, and
  recorded as per-concept evidence;
- **unseen transfer probes** — two authored situations on different surfaces
  (QR phishing; an unexpected update package) that record the learner's first
  response before any feedback or replay.

Everything in this layer is authored and deterministic. There is no language
model anywhere in it, at import time or at runtime, and no free-text grading.

Concept evidence is an authored training signal, not a validated psychological
diagnosis or mastery score. RewindSec computes no global mastery percentage,
and **no claim of improved learning is made** — there is no human data yet.

See [docs/learning-layer.md](docs/learning-layer.md).

---

## Research mode

RewindSec ships the infrastructure for a randomised controlled pilot of the
phishing module. It is **disabled by default** and adds nothing to a normal
deployment: with it off, every `/study` route returns 404, no enrollment can be
created, and the ordinary training and learning flows are untouched.

```bash
export REWINDSEC_STUDY_ENABLED=1
export REWINDSEC_STUDY_ASSIGNMENT_SECRET=<high-entropy value>
export REWINDSEC_STUDY_ACCESS_CODE=<code given to participants>
```

Both secrets are mandatory when research mode is on; without either, the flow
fails closed rather than allocating under an empty key or serving without a
gate. Neither is Flask's `secret_key`.

The protocol compares three interventions on the same phishing scenario, with
an identical first decision in every arm:

- `awareness_debrief` — a concise conventional awareness debrief;
- `factual_consequence` — the learner's own response executed and shown;
- `counterfactual_replay` — factual consequence, verified rewind, paired
  comparison and structured self-explanation.

All three then answer the same immediate transfer probe, and a delayed one
7–14 days later. Allocation is by keyed, reproducible, permuted blocks of six.
Participants are identified only by a UUID4; no name, email, student id or
demographic field is collected anywhere, and there is no free-text input in the
flow. Instructor-only descriptive counts and a CSV export are available at
`/study/admin`.

**No efficacy claim is made.** This is infrastructure to test a question, not
evidence about it: no participant has been recruited, and the application
computes no p-value, effect size or significance test. Enabling research mode is
an operational setting and does not constitute ethics approval, participant
consent, or study registration.

See [docs/study-protocol.md](docs/study-protocol.md).

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests -q
```

Tests run entirely against pytest temp directories and a throwaway SQLite
database — they never touch the developer's files or the real `simulator.db`.

Docker integration and containment tests skip automatically when Docker or the
target image is unavailable. To run them, build the image first:

```bash
docker build -t dark-web-sandbox-target:latest -f docker/sandbox-target/Dockerfile .
```

With the image present the whole suite runs with **no skips**; the Docker tests
create and destroy their own short-lived containers and always clean up.

## RewindSec 2.0 Batch 6 operations

The normal product starts at `/` or `/start`; its workstation and debrief are
`/workstation` and `/results`. The trainer console starts at `/trainer/login`
and continues under `/trainer`. Active browser code uses the canonical
`/api/...` endpoints. Historical `/prototype/...` browser URLs redirect to the
matching clean route, while exact legacy API paths remain narrow compatibility
aliases.

Historical v1 training, learning, study and instructor sandbox routes remain in
source for provenance but are not mounted by default. A deliberate historical regression run may set
`REWINDSEC_ENABLE_LEGACY_V1_SURFACES=1`; do not use that setting as the 2.0
product. Development-only simulation controls are likewise off unless
`REWINDSEC2_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS=1` is explicitly set.

### Docker 2.0 purpose and ownership

Docker is only an isolated technical projection of four allowlisted synthetic
ransomware file states. The database-backed RewindSec world decides and stores
every consequence first. Docker never selects a file, consumes simulation RNG,
advances time, scores an action or changes incident history. Missing/stale
containers are reconstructed from persisted truth; a daemon/image/reconcile
failure is an operational diagnostic and does not become simulation truth.

Build the separately versioned v2 target from the repository root:

```bash
docker build --pull=false -t rewindsec2-ransomware-sandbox:2.0 -f docker/rewindsec2-target/Dockerfile .
```

The base tag is `python:3.12-slim`; record the resulting image ID/digest in each
validation run. Normal sandbox operation requires no download, DNS or network.
Runtime containers use network-none, numeric non-root identity, read-only root,
all capabilities dropped, no-new-privileges, no host mounts/socket, an 8 MiB
hardened tmpfs workspace, 64 MiB memory, 32 PIDs and 0.50 CPU. Set
`REWINDSEC2_SANDBOX_IMAGE` only to an operator-controlled equivalent target, or
`REWINDSEC2_SANDBOX_ENABLED=0` for a clearly uncontained development run.

Run machine-readable engineering validation and actual-container checks:

```bash
python -m evaluation.rewindsec2.run_validation --samples 30 --concurrent-sessions 8 --output evaluation/results/rewindsec2/batch6-engineering-validation.json
python -m evaluation.rewindsec2.containment --output evaluation/results/rewindsec2/batch6-docker-containment.json
python -m pytest
```

The first two output paths are intentionally gitignored machine-specific
results. Their schema/provenance definitions live in
`evaluation/rewindsec2/evidence_registry.json`. A dirty-tree run is preliminary
engineering evidence only. After review and commit, rerun the exact commands on
the clean final commit to create citation-ready technical evidence. Historical
`evaluation/results_manifest.json`, formal v1 result files and v1 harnesses are
separate and must not be overwritten or relabelled.

The implemented threat boundary and residual limits are in
`docs/rewindsec2-security-misuse.md`. The required human checkpoint is in
`docs/rewindsec2-final-manual-validation.md`; automated checks do not establish
usability, realism, learning, retention, competence, transfer or psychometric
validity.
