"""Shared helpers for the R7 study suites.

Research mode is **off by default**, which is exactly the property
``test_study_gating.py`` asserts. These suites therefore turn it on through
``app.config`` rather than through the environment: the ``flask_app`` fixture is
session-scoped and imports the app once, and re-importing it per test to change
an environment variable would be slower and would not test the code path a
running deployment uses either. The routes read ``study_settings()`` on every
request, so flipping the config is the same switch an operator flips.

The clock is injectable in exactly one place -- ``StudyService.record_attempt``
and the retention-state checks take a ``now`` -- so the seven- and fourteen-day
boundaries are tested by moving the stored window, never by sleeping.
