"""Guardrails for the RewindSec 2.0 UI prototype.

These tests do not try to prove that the prototype looks good -- that is what
the manual product gate is for, and a unit test asserting visual quality would
be theatre. What they hold are the properties a reviewer cannot check by
looking, and that would be expensive to discover late:

* every screen renders;
* every destination in the fixture content is inert;
* the organisation and the people in it are fictional;
* no hostile event announces itself on the learner-visible surface;
* Assessment mode suppresses in-attempt coaching and the safer-alternative
  screen;
* the prototype cannot change server state, because it has no way to;
* the mock layer stays isolated from v1 and from the deterministic core;
* the v1 surfaces still work.
