"""The storage-independent repository contract for :class:`SimulationSession`.

This module defines the *port* (in the hexagonal-architecture sense): the
interface every persistence adapter must satisfy, expressed only in terms of
``rewindsec.domain`` objects and stdlib exceptions. It imports nothing from
SQLAlchemy, Flask, or any other storage technology, so the domain -- and any
test exercising it -- never has to know which adapter, if any, is behind it.

Concurrency contract
---------------------
Every session aggregate carries a ``revision`` counter
(:attr:`~rewindsec.domain.session.SimulationSession.revision`), bumped on
every accepted mutation. A caller loads a session at some revision, applies
zero or more in-memory mutations (which may bump the revision by any amount),
and then calls :meth:`SessionRepository.update` passing the revision it
*loaded at* as ``expected_revision``. The adapter must reject the update with
:class:`StaleRevisionError` unless ``expected_revision`` equals the revision
currently stored -- optimistic concurrency, not a lock -- so a caller working
from a stale read learns that immediately instead of silently overwriting
whatever another writer stored in the meantime.
