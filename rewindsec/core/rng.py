"""Deterministic seeded randomness with independent named streams.

A RewindSec 2.0 simulation owns exactly one :class:`SeededRandom`. Every value
the simulation invents -- which message arrives, which persona sends it, how
long a consequence is delayed, which distractors are present -- is drawn from
it, and from nothing else. ``secrets``, ``uuid``, the global ``random``
functions and the wall clock are all forbidden in the deterministic core
precisely so that this module is the only door randomness can come through.

Why named streams
-----------------
A single shared generator makes a simulation reproducible but *fragile*: the
day someone adds one extra draw to mail generation, every later timing and
persona value shifts, and every stored session stops replaying. Streams are
therefore derived independently::

    stream_seed = SHA-256(f"{_DERIVATION_LABEL}|{root_seed}|{stream_name}")

so adding, removing or consuming a stream cannot perturb any other stream.
The derivation uses SHA-256 rather than ``hash()`` because CPython salts
``hash()`` per process, which would make a stored session replay differently
on the next run -- the exact failure this module exists to prevent.

Materialisation and restore contract
------------------------------------
* Streams are **materialised lazily**: a stream exists only once
  :meth:`SeededRandom.stream` has been asked for it. An unmaterialised stream
  is indistinguishable from a materialised-but-unconsumed one, because both
  derive from the same root seed.
* :meth:`SeededRandom.capture_state` serialises **only materialised streams**.
* :meth:`SeededRandom.restore_state` **replaces** the stream table: after a
  restore, exactly the streams named in the payload exist, positioned exactly
  where they were. Streams materialised after the captured moment are dropped,
  which is correct -- at the captured moment they had not been used.
* Asking for a stream the restored payload did not contain derives it freshly
  from the root seed, i.e. unconsumed. Correct for the same reason.

That contract is what makes a checkpoint restore reproduce the recorded event
stream instead of rerolling it.
